# Jammming

Jammming is a web application built using the React framework. It allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, and then save the custom playlist to their Spotify account. The first time a user searches for a song, album, or artist, Jammming redirects the user to log into their Spotify account. 

A user can type the name of a song, artist, or album into the search bar and click the SEARCH button to request song data from the Spotify library. Jammming then displays a list of returned tracks from the users query. Tracks can be added or removed by clicking the (+) and (-) buttons, respectively. Users also have the ability to change the name of the playlist to something of their choice before clicking the SAVE TO SPOTIFY button.
